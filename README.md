This project will showcase data collected from the video game, World of Warcraft. World of Warcraft (WoW) has consistently been one of the most popular and highest grossing MMO RPGS on the market since not long after its release in 2004.


Principles successfully demonstrated in this project:
* Explored the data, handling null values, and looked into potential data integrity errors.
* Outlined multiple hypotheses to be tested with identification of the dependent and independent variables.
* Utilized data visualization tools in seaborn and matplotlib along with statistical hypothesis tests (T-Test, ANOVA, and Tukey HSD) to form conclusions and potential other considerations outside of the scope of this project.
